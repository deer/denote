# Welcome to Denote

Denote is a modern documentation platform built on **Deno** and **Fresh v2**.
It's designed to help you create beautiful, fast documentation sites with
minimal effort.

## Why Denote?

Traditional documentation tools often require complex build steps, heavy
dependencies, and configuration. Denote takes a different approach:

- **Zero Config**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **Deno Native**: Built on Deno's secure runtime - no node_modules needed
- **Fresh v2**: Server-rendered with minimal client JavaScript
- **Markdown First**: Write your docs in Markdown with frontmatter

## Quick Example

Here's a simple documentation file:

```markdown
---
title: My Page
description: A simple documentation page

# Hello World

Welcome to my documentation!
```
